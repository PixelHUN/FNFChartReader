# Creating a Character

Implementing your character doesn't *require* modifying any source code, so even if you don't understand **GML** you'll have a fairly easy time implementing your character.
I'll use Mommy Mearest as an example.

## Get your sprites ready

### Exporting your sprites
If you made your characters graphics in an external program (like *Adobe Animate*), then you'll have to export each of your animations as a PNG Sequence.

Here is Mom in Adobe Animate:

You can easily export the characters animations, by finding the animation sequence on the right, right clicking it and clicking Export PNG Sequence.

Mom's idle animation:<br>

Export all your animations (Idle, Sing Left, Sing Right, Sing Up, Sing Down)<br>
It's a good practice to keep all your files organized, since we'll be doing some trickery with them.<br>
