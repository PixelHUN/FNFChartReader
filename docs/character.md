# Creating a Character

Implementing your character doesn't *require* modifying any source code, so even if you don't understand **GML** you'll have a fairly easy time implementing your character.
I'll use Mommy Mearest as an example.

### Get your sprites ready

If you made your characters graphics in an external program (like *Adobe Animate*), then you'll have to export each of your animations as a PNG Sequence.

Here is Mom in Adobe Animate:
