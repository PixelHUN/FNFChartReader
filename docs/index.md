# FNF Chart Reader (aka FNF GMS2 remake)
 
A Friday Night Funkin' chart reader made in Game Maker: Studio 2, and a remake of the game (still being in very early stages).

**Original Game:** https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin

**Go give all the support to the original developers!!!**

# Current State

FNF Chart Reader, as the name suggests, can:
 - Read Charts (from original game **and Kade Engine made charts**) **However it must not be formatted in any way**
 - Play Charts
 - Character Support
 - Stage Support
 - Easily modifiably reading Included Files rather then packing up all the files

# Development Progress

My goal is to create an *as close as possible* remake of FNF in GMS2, while making it as easily modifiably as I can.
 - [x] Make characters and stages be read from a file
 - [ ] Implement all characters
 - [ ] Implement all stages
 - [ ] Implement a week system
 - [ ] Make weeks be read from a file
 - [ ] Implement all weeks
 - [ ] Mod support (without file replacing)
 - [ ] QoL features (such as downscroll, scroll speed modifiers)
